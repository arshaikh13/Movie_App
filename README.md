Purpose: This is a movie catalog and review app created to allow users to view, add, update, delete, or rate their favorite movies. The app has two main modes: admin mode and user mode. 
In admin mode, administrators can add new movies, update existing movies, or delete movies from the system. In user mode, users can search for movies, rate movies, add comments to movies,
and like comments made by other users.

Program Overview: Since there are two different modes, each mode has its own capabilities. Admins are able to update, add, and delete movies. Whereas a normal user doesn't have the same capabilities.
Thus in order to ensure permissions are given to the right user, an authentication system has been integrated. The user may navigate through the menus and choose which task they would like
to complete. Going to the admin menu will require a username (admin) and password (password). Then the user will be free to complete any task they want. However, take note that leaving the admin menu will 
reset the authentication. If you are only looking to rate, view, or comment on a movie, then you will be able to do so without logging in. Lastly, for the convenience of the user, a search method has been 
integrated into this app. So you won't have to go looking for a movie throughout the entire catalog.
